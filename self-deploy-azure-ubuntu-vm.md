* Choose the `Windows Server` software plan that meets our [system requirement](/deploying-bold-bi/overview/#hardware-requirements) and click `Create`.

    ![Windows Server Select](images/self-vm-windows-server-select.png)

* Provide the necessary administrative information for the new VM on the `Basics` blade.

    ![Basic](images/self-vm-basic.png)

**Virtual Machine Name:** Enter a name for your VM (max 15 characters).

**VM disk type:** Choose SSD/HDD as your convenience (SSD is recommended for better performance).

**Size:** Choose the VM size that meets our [system requirement](/deploying-bold-bi/overview/#hardware-requirements). For example, choose the `D2s_V3` size, and then click `Select`.

**Username:** Enter your username, which you will use to log in to the VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

**Password:** Enter your password, as you will need it to log in to the VM using RDP.

**Subscription:** This VM should be associated with the Azure subscription.

**Resource group:** Choose `Create new` and enter the name of a new resource group to host the VM's resources.

**Region:** Choose your preferred region for your VM.

* Under the `Disks` blade, choose the VM OS disk type (`SSD` is recommended).

* Under the `Networking` blade, select `Advanced` in `NIC network security group`.

    ![Networking](images/self-vm-networking.png)

* Click on `Create new` in the `NIC network security group` option to add an inbound security rule. This rule will allow specific types of internet traffic to reach your VM. 

    ![Add inbound rule](images/self-vm-add-inbound-rule.png)

* Choose `HTTP` from the `Service` drop-down list on the `Add inbound security rule` blade.

* In the "Priority" box, assign a numerical priority to the rule, such as 100. Rules with lower numbers are processed first. For instance, a rule with a priority of 100 will be processed before a rule with a priority of 110.

* In the Name box, type a name for the inbound rule, such as HTTP Port-80, and then click OK.

* Repeat the steps to create an inbound security rule for the HTTPS service with a priority of 101.

* When finished, the Create network security group dialog should have three rules allowing `RDP, HTTP, and HTTPS` access. Click OK.

* On the `Create` blade, review your settings under Summary and click `Create`.
